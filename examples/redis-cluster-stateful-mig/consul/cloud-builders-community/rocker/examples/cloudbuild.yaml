# This example uses rocker to build a rocker builder. Notice that we call
# `rocker build`, not `docker build`.
#
# Note that we assume you have previously built and pushed image
# `gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/rocker`; if you haven't done that, walk up one level from
# here and build that before running this example.
#
# In this directory, run the following command to build this example:
# $ gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml .

steps:
# Use Rockerfile to Build the image 'rocker:latest'; note that this TAG is
# defined in the Rockerfile.
- name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/rocker'
  args: ['build', '-f', 'Rockerfile', '.']
# If we were successful, the rocker-built rocker image will work:
- name: 'rocker:latest'
  args: ['info']

# Note that we don't push this image.
