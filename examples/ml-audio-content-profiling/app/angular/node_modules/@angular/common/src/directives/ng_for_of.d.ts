/**
 * The `NgForOf` directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable. The context
 * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable
 * set to the current item from the iterable.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Local Variables
 *
 * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:
 *
 * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).
 * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is
 * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |
 * async`).
 * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.
 * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.
 * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.
 * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.
 * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.
 *
 * ```
 * <li *ngFor="let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst">
 *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
 * </li>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Change Propagation
 *
 * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce
 * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful
 * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can
 * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state
 * such as user input.
 *
 * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.
 * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that
 * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with
 * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old
 * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should
 * be avoided if possible.
 *
 * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.
 * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.
 * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * - `<li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>`
 *
 * With `<ng-template>` element:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed
 * example.
