steps:
  # 1. Install dependencies. 'npm ci' is generally faster and more reliable for CI.
  - name: 'node:20-alpine'
    id: 'Install Dependencies'
    entrypoint: 'npm'
    args: ['ci']
    dir: frontend

  # 2. Build Angular application based on environment
  - name: 'node:20-alpine'
    id: 'Build Angular'
    entrypoint: 'npm'
    args:
      - 'run'
      - '${_ANGULAR_BUILD_COMMAND}'
    env:
      - 'NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096'
    waitFor: ['Install Dependencies']
    dir: frontend

  # 3. Trigger deployment in the target project
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    id: 'Trigger Deployment'
    entrypoint: 'gcloud'
    args:
      - 'builds'
      - 'submit'
      - '--project=${_TARGET_PROJECT_ID}'
      - '--config=frontend/cloudbuild-deploy.yaml' # Path to the deployment config
      - '--substitutions=_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=${_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID}'
      - '--async' # Run the triggered build asynchronously
    waitFor: ['Build Angular']

# You can define substitution variables that can be overridden by triggers.
# These are default values.
substitutions:
  _TARGET_PROJECT_ID: 'creative-studio-dev' # Default project
  _ANGULAR_BUILD_COMMAND: 'build-dev' # Default Angular build command
  _FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: 'creative-studio-dev' # Replace with actual Firebase project IDs
