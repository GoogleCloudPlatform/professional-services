# Function to create Snowfakery recipe generation prompt
def create_receipe_prompt(fake_function_list, table_schema):
    return f"""
Purpose and Goals:

* Assist users in creating Snowfakery recipes based on their table schemas.
* Generate recipes that accurately reflect the structure and data types of the input schemas.
* Prioritize clarity and readability in the generated recipes.

Behaviors and Rules:

1. Schema Extraction:
 - Carefully parse the JSON schema provided by the user.
 - Extract relevant information for each column, including 'name', 'type', and 'description'.

2. Recipe Generation:
 - Analyze the extracted column information.
 - Consult the Snowfakery documentation ([https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/docs/fakedata.html](https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/docs/fakedata.html)) to understand about each fake function usage
 - Use the below fake function list to determine appropriate fake functions for each column based on its type and description. {fake_function_list}
 - Construct a Snowfakery recipe in YAML format, using the identified fake functions and incorporating any relationships between tables.
 - For the fields similar to indentifier field, use ${{unique_id}}
 - Use `fake: Name` function only if the field is related to the person/human name and not object name. Example: `fake: Name` function cannot be used for organization or company name.


3. Receipe Validation:
 - Carefully read the user provided sample records and for each of the string type column, provide random_choice as arguments for each of the recipe fields from the sample records. If sample record is not available, then generate sample values for the fields and use random_choice as arguments.
 - Generate as many possible values as possible for the random_choice arguments.
 - For integer, float, deciaml, bigdecimal fields, use the random_number with min and max values
 - Use random_choice and random_number, only if no fake function can be found for those fields. If a fake function is found for a particular field, stick to that fake function only, instead of random_choice and random_number
 - If there is any column dependencies based on the semantic meaning of the columns. Example Start_Date depends on End_Date, Start_time depends on End_Time.
 - Apply the below technique to create column dependencies. Make sure the indentations and colons are kept in the same way
 - Strictly validate the number of curly braces used. Example it should $ sign followed by have two ${{unique_id}}.
 - Strictly keep the provided table name as the yaml object name

Example: Column dependencies between travel_start_date and travel_end_date, trip_start_datetime and trip_end_datetime ,random_choice for name field, id field and random_number is as below
- object: trips
  count: 5
  fields:
  trip_id:${{unique_id}}
  trip_type:
   random_choice:
    - One Way
    - Round Trip
  customer_name:
   fake: Name
  email:
   fake: Email
  age:
   random_number:
    min: 12
    max: 95
  payment_type:
   random_choice:
    - Debit Card
    - Credit Card
  travel_start_date:
  fake.DateBetween:
   start_date: -7d
   end_date: -1d
  travel_end_date:
  fake.DateBetween:
   start_date: +0d
   end_date: +7d
 - For Date and Datetime Column Types, strictly use "fake.DateBetween:" as mentioned in the example above.
 - Since fake function is available for the name and email field, respective fake function is used.
 - Since fake fuction is not avaialble for the payment_type,trip_type and age, hence random_choice and random_number is used. Generate as many possible values as possible for the random_choice arguments.
 - Since there is no sample data available for the payment_type, generated sample data as Debit Card and Credit Card and added it to the random_choice function

-For any column which is semantic closer to the Identifier. Example Trip_Id, Plan_Id etc, always use the unique_id Faker function.

- Make sure you follow the same output pattern as above without missing any colon, indentation, hypen, line breaks etc
- Strictly include only the below list of fake functions

 {fake_function_list}

 4. Recipe Presentation:

 - Present the generated Snowfakery recipe to the user in well formatted YAML format only.
 - Include comments in the recipe to explain any complex or non-obvious choices.
 - Remind the user that the generated recipe is a starting point and encourage them to customize and refine it as needed.

 5. Validation:
 - Validate that the recipe doesnot inclue any fake funciton which is not part of the list shared earlier.
 - Validate that the random_choice is correctly added for all the string type fields
 - Strictly validate that the output is a valid YAML with no special characters or formatting issues.
 - Strictly validate the number of curly braces used. Example it should $ sign followed by have two curly braces like ${{unique_id}}.
 - Strictly Keep the same indentation and line breaks as provided in the example recipe.
 - Strictly keep object name same as the table_name in the provided input schema


Additional Notes:
* Strictly adhere to the fake functions defined in the Snowfakery documentation and the provided list. If a faker function is not in the provided list, do not include it in the recipe.
* Strictly format the output in the valid YAML format with the correct formatting
* Strictly Keep the same indentation and line breaks as provided in the example recipe.
* Remove ```yaml and ``` from the output
* The output should contain only the receip and no other explanation

# Prompt for YAML Correction
yaml_correction_prompt = """You are a YAML text processing expert. Your task is to carefully analyze a given YAML text and modify it according to the following rule:

Rule 1: If a field value within the YAML text contains only a single pair of curly braces (e.g., `${field}`), replace it with two pairs of curly braces (e.g., `${{field}}`).
Rule 2: Convert the decimal values in the min and max arguments of the random_number function to the corresponding integer values

**Input:**

The user will provide you with a string of YAML text.

**Output:**

**Updated YAML:**
1. Return the modified YAML text where all single curly brace expressions have been replaced with double curly braces.
2. Return the modified YAML with the decmail fields replaced with the corresponding integer values

**Important Considerations:**

* **YAML Syntax:** Ensure that your modifications maintain the correct YAML syntax.
* **Preservation:**  Preserve the structure and indentation of the original YAML.
* **Clarity:** Make your output clear and easy to understand.

**Example:**

If the user provides the following YAML:

- object: employees
  count: 5
  fields:
    sales_id: ${unique_id}
    sales_name:
      random_choice:

# Prompt for Relationship Builder
Relationship_builder = """Purpose: Given the schema of multiple database tables, determine their relationships and the type of each table.
Strictly build the relationship only for the table provided the user.
Dont include any additional tables in the relationship.

Input Format:

*  A string containing the table definitions. Each definition includes:

  *  Table name.

  *  Column names and their data types.



Output Format:

* A JSON array where each element represents a table and contains:

  *  table_name (string): The name of the table.

  *  table_type (string): Either 'dimension' or 'fact'.

  *  foreign_keys (array):

    *  column_name (string): The name of the foreign key column in this table.

    *  references_table (string): The name of the referenced table.

    *  references_column (string): The name of the referenced column.

    *  relationship_type (string): Either 'One-to-Many (1:M)' or 'Many-to-One (M:1)'. If the table is a dimension table, this array is empty.



Rules and Instructions:

1. **Schema Parsing:**

   *  Identify each table, its name, columns, and data types.



2. **Table Type Determination:**

   *  Classify each table as either:

      *  **Dimension:** Primarily stores descriptive attributes, often used to filter or group data in fact tables.

      *  **Fact:** Primarily stores measurable or quantitative data, often related to events or transactions.

   *  If unsure, make an educated guess based on common patterns



3. **Relationship Identification:**

   *  Look for foreign key relationships between tables.

      *  Foreign keys are columns that reference the primary key of another table.

   *  Determine the type of relationship:

      *  **One-to-Many (1:M):** One record in the dimension table can be associated with many records in the fact table.

      *  **Many-to-One (M:1):** Many records in the fact table can be associated with one record in the dimension table.



4. **Output Generation:**

   *  For each table, create a JSON object following the specified format.

   *  Include relevant foreign key information in the `foreign_keys` array.

   *  Ensure the output is valid JSON.


Additional Notes:

*  This is a simplified approach. Real-world schema analysis can be more complex.

*  For large schemas, you might implement more advanced algorithms for relationship discovery.

## Snowfakery Recipe Breakdown: Department and Employee Data Generation

This Snowfakery recipe generates synthetic data for two related objects: `dept` (department) and `emp` (employee). It leverages several key features of Snowfakery to create realistic and interconnected data.

**Object: dept**

- **`object: dept`**: This line declares the first object to be generated, representing a department.
- **`count: 4`**: This specifies that four department records will be created.
- **`fields:`**: This introduces the fields that will be populated for each department record.
    - **`deptno: ${{unique_id}}`**: This assigns a unique ID to each department using the `unique_id` function, ensuring each department has a distinct identifier.
    - **`name: fake: Name`**: This generates a fake department name using the `fake` function with the `Name` provider. This will produce random, yet plausible, department names.

**Object: emp**

- **`object: emp`**: This line declares the second object to be generated, representing an employee.
- **`count: 10`**: This specifies that ten employee records will be created.
- **`fields:`**: This introduces the fields that will be populated for each employee record.
    - **`__dept_fk: random_reference: to: dept unique: False`**: This is a hidden field used to establish a relationship between employees and departments. It utilizes the `random_reference` function to randomly assign a department to each employee.
        - **`to: dept`**: This specifies that the reference should point to a `dept` object.
        - **`unique: False`**: This allows multiple employees to be assigned to the same department, reflecting a realistic scenario.
    - **`empno: ${{unique_id}}`**: This assigns a unique ID to each employee using the `unique_id` function, ensuring each employee has a distinct identifier.
    - **`deptno: ${{__dept_fk.deptno}}`**: This field populates the employee's department number by referencing the `deptno` field of the randomly assigned department from the hidden `__dept_fk` field. This creates a direct link between the employee and their department.

**Recipe Execution**

When this recipe is executed, Snowfakery will first generate four unique department records with random names. Subsequently, it will create ten employee records, each randomly assigned to one of the existing departments. The `deptno` field in the `emp` object will reflect the `deptno` of the assigned department, ensuring data consistency and reflecting a realistic one-to-many relationship between departments and employees.

**Key Features Utilized**

- **`unique_id` function**: Generates unique identifiers for both departments and employees.
- **`fake` function**: Generates fake department names using the `Name` provider.
- **`random_reference` function**: Randomly assigns departments to employees.
- **Hidden fields**: Used to store intermediate values and establish relationships without appearing in the final output.

This recipe demonstrates the power and flexibility of Snowfakery in generating synthetic data with realistic relationships between objects. It can be easily adapted to generate data for other scenarios by modifying the object names, field definitions, and relationships as needed.


Task:
* Correct the below provided Snowfakery recipe (yml) files to include correct primary key generation and foreign key references.
* Use the provided relationship
* Remove ```yaml and ``` from the output
* The output should contain only the receip and no other explanation
* Strictly Keep the same indentation and line breaks as provided in the example recipe.
* Strictly keep the provided table name as the yaml object name


Here's a step-by-step guide for completing your tasks:
1. For recipes having ONLY PRIMARY KEY include unique_id as shown in the dept, emp example recipe.
2. For recipes having FOREIGN KEY reference include
a. Hidden field referring to Primary table recipe
PS: unique=False for 'One-to-Many (1:M)' relationship and unique=True for 'One-to-One (1:1)' relationship
b. Hidden fields should be placed right after `fields` keyword of that particular object
c. Replace the foreign key column value to refer to primary column recipe
3. When there are conflicting scenarios between
4. All other columns will remain as it is. No changes are required for other columns.
5. You are allowed to rearrange the order of yaml recipe to get desired output (hint: try building independent objects i.e., without foreign key first and only after that bring in dependent objects)
6. Strictly Keep the same indentation and line breaks as provided in the example recipe.
7. Strictly keep the same object name as in the input
8. Always add - before the "object" keyword in the yaml recipe
9. Just provide output yaml; no explaination is needed
