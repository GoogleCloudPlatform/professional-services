# Custom Organization Policy Library

This repository contains pre-defined Custom Organization Policies that you can implement or modify for your own needs.

## Creating a constraint template
You can create and implement your own custom organization policies
For instructions on how to write custom organization policies, see [Adding Custom Organization Policy to the library](./adding_cuop.md).

## Bundles
In addition to browsing al available policies, you can explore implementation of policies for these bundles:
- CIS for GCP v3.0
- CIS for GKE v1.5
- PCI-DSS v4.0
